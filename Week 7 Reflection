Week 7
Ive had some troubl with the image classifier but I have done quiet a bit of research to try and figure this imagining out. After some of my research I would like to say ive got the hang of it but im not totally sure, yet i would not say this research is a fail because of the better general understanding I have.
The recognision and labeling of programs/images is the purpose of this tool along with the use of AI allowing it to categories and learn not only people or just images but further into other technology.
On to the reading portion I picked the first reading assigned to go in depth about in this reflection Morgan, Colleen. 2019. ‘Avatars, Monsters, and Machines: A Cyborg Archaeology’. European Journal of Archaeology 22.3, 324-337. Along with the two mandatory articles.
The articles highlight the reasoning for change, they obviously go far in depth but the point that was perceived to me was archaeology is changing because of new technologies, places, and moral issues. There is heavy discussion about passion and people basically putting a piece of themselves into this great big project that allows many opinions and passions to become clear and taking studies past just "regular" places and the reasoning behing my quotations is because the line of normal has been completly obliterated.
The lines of archeology have been changed and so much creativity has been brought in beyond earth or someting you can physically hold or see.
